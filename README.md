# Pizza Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a Pizza company for a year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify, make data-driving recommendation, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Analysis and Visualization
- Power Query - Data Cleaning
- VBA - Creating Report


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data loading and importation
2. Handling missing value and outliers
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

- What is overall sales trend?
- What Pizzas are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales period?

  ### Data Analysis

  Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel

  ### Results/Findings

  The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 1. The Month of April generates the most revenue, while the least revenue was generated in May
 2. Many people are returning to work after the weekend and may be less inclined to order Pizza on Mondays
 3. Most orders came in by 12pm and 1pm
 4. The top 5 selling Pizza contributed to more thaan 40% of total revenue
 5. Most of our customers prefers the Supreme Pizza
  
  ### Recommendations

  1. Run limited-time promotions to create a sense of urgency and encourage immediate purchases
  2. Consider bundling deals like "pizza and wings" or "pizza and a drink". For months with low sales
  3. Offer a combo deal where these low-selling pizzas are bundled with popular ones
  4. Use visually appealing images and engaging content to showcase these pizzas
  5. Collaborate with companies to offer exclusive lunch deals to their employees on Mondays
